Step 1. Import the necessary libraries
 ANS:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
Step 2. Import the dataset from this address.

Step 3. Assign it to a variable called euro12.
  ANS:
euro = pd.read_csv('URL.csv')
euro
Step 4. Select only the Goal column.
  ANS:
euro.Goals
Step 5. How many team participated in the Euro2012?
  ANS:
euro.Team.nunique()
Step 6. What is the number of columns in the dataset?
  ANS:
euro.shape[1]
Step 7. View only the columns Team, Yellow Cards and Red Cards and assign them to a dataframe called discipline
 ANS:
 discipline = euro[['Team', 'Yellow Cards', 'Red Cards']]
 discipline
Step 8. Sort the teams by Red Cards, then to Yellow Cards
 ANS:
 discipline.sort_values(by=['Red Cards', 'Yellow Cards'], inplace = True)
discipline
Step 9. Calculate the mean Yellow Cards given per Team
 ANS:
 discipline['Yellow Cards'].sum() / len(discipline['Yellow Cards'])
discipline['Yellow Cards'].mean()
Step 10. Filter teams that scored more than 6 goals
 ANS:
 euro[euro['Goals'] > 6]
Step 11. Select the teams that start with G
 ANS:
 euro[euro.Team.str.startswith('G')]
Step 12. Select the first 7 columns
 ANS: 
euro.head(7)
Step 13. Select all columns except the last 3.
  ANS:
euro.iloc[: , 0:-3]
Step 14. Present only the Shooting Accuracy from England, Italy and Russia
 ANS: 
euro.loc[euro.Team.isin(['England', 'Italy', 'Russia']), ['Team','Shooting Accuracy']]
